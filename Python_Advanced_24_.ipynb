Also, a second instruction to import the MOD1.py module can be found in the related MOD2.py file. In this case, the loop will never terminate. Simply using the conditional statement if name == \"main\" will fix this problem. No direct references to the function itself are allowed within the function itself. Programs that lack this statement tend to get stuck in a never-ending loop, so adding it was a smart move."
