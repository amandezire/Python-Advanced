You'll have a lot of leeway with this. You do this by associating the name of an attribute with a descriptor class you've created that defines the get, set, and delete methods.The property function provides a convenient means of implementing a basic descriptor without the need to create a new class specifically for that purpose. It is possible to define an attribute's behaviour without defining the entire class; instead, we can write getter and setter method functions and tie them to the attribute name."
